Yeah, that's right. Rust. Let's talk about it.

## What is Rust?

Have you ever encountered a segmentation fault in C++? I'm sure you have. If you've taken any of the main programming courses at Kent State, you definitely have (I'm looking at you CS2). I could give you the true high-level breakdown of Rust but at it's core, it aims to solve that one problem: **Pointers are evil**

Now, I don't literally mean *pointers are evil*. Pointers are great. We love to use them and they have a lot of uses for us in programming. In reality, when I say pointers are evil, I mean that *pointers to dynamic memory that we allocated ourselves are evil*. That's a mouthful though, I mean try saying that 3x fast. Rust aims to fix this. The term we use for this, is called **memory safety**.

So, now let me answer that question: what is Rust? It's a tool like every other programming language. It has it's uses and there are times where you should and shouldn't use it. It has it's pros and cons, just like Python, C++ and any other language you can name off the top of your head (yes, even Lisp, even though I hope nobody is thinking about Lisp).

## Okay, let's talk applications of Rust

... I need to think of a good example ...
